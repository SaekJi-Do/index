PGM Piet on Crack is the name of an esolang which refers to the netpbm format for greymaps. Piet is a stack-based esoteric programming language in which programs look like abstract paintings. It uses 20 colors, of which 18 are related cyclically through a lightness cycle and a hue cycle. A single stack is used for data storage, together with some unusual operations. Pgmpiet uses 256 values, 253 of which are related linearly through a value channel and a depth channel. Pgmpiet is, however registry based.

A standard program would look like a screenshot of a pgm file. e.g.
